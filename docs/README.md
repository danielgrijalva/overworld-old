### About

If you use Letterboxd you probably know what this project is about. If not...

**Overworld** is a place where you can share your gaming experiences, keep track of what you play, discover games, manage your backlog, show love to your favorite games, write reviews, compile lists of specific games and _More Stuff™_.

Follow other people to discuss or discover new games, or you can be a lone wolf and use it as a personal gaming journal.

The project is still in early development. If you have any suggestions, [file an issue](https://github.com/danielgrijalva/overworld/issues/new/choose) or even better, [start contributing](getting-started/contributing.md)!

#### Inspiration

Overworld is _heavily_ inspired by [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/), both in functionality, design and the overall user experience.
